    Make sure to go through the currently open [issues][]. Don't forget to check the `genume.log` for any useful information. Not necessary but suggested to pass your code from the pycodestyle check by running `make lint`. When asking general 'how to' questions, use an appropriate resource such as [Stack Overflow][]. If any uncertainities persist, feel free to read our [Support][] markdown file.

- Describe the feature

    A clear and concise description of what the idea is. Remember to go through our [Contribution Guides][] markdown file and, especially, the Contributing to Issues section.

- Screenshots

    If applicable, add screenshots or any other sorts of visual assistance to help explain your idea and communicate your findings more effortlessly.

- Additional context

    Is Genume's current customizability insufficient to support this feature? Add any other context about the problem here.

- Clean up your report

    Remove any unnecessary information from the template. It's not required, it just makes your report easier to read.
